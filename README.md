# NeovimPersonalSetup
My step plan for configuring neovim and NvChad as working enviroment on ubuntu.
This guide is for installing **locally** and **NOT** for installing it with root access.
The reason why was originally due to remote working as a user.

## For this plan to work are three steps required to follow.
1. Install Nerd or Hack font
- If some symbols don't load correctly, it can be due to the version of the downloaded font. Try downloading a different version or font to solve this problem
2. Install Neovim
3. Install NvChad

## General inks where I downloaded all required files
1. https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads
2. https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad
3. https://github.com/neovim
```


## Step one -- Install a font through command line

## Step two -- Install Neovim

## Step three -- Install NvChad
